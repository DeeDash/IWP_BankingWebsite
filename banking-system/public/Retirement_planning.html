                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">When you begin your career, retirement might seem like a distant
                    idea,
                    but as the years pass on, and you reach the age of 60, you have to retire. Retirement is inevitable,
                    and
                    comes with its unique set of pros and cons. While for some people, retirement might sound difficult
                    as
                    it brings an abrupt halt to the fixed routine and schedule, for others it could be the phase where
                    the
                    years of slogging - to meet one's professional commitments - ends, resulting in the much-needed
                    relaxation. If you have made planned investments early in life - for your long-term goals- the
                    post-retirement years could well be the proverbial golden years of your life. Retirement planning by
                    making sound investments decisions is the key to enjoy and relax with your loved ones.</p>

                    that you continue to meet all your goals and dreams independently. This includes setting your
                    retirement goals, estimating the amount of money you will need, and investing to grow your
                    retirement savings.

                    Every retirement plan is unique. After all, you may have very specific ideas on how you want to
                    spend your retired life. This is why it’s important to have a plan that is designed specifically to
                    suit your individual needs.</p>

                <h1 class="sectionTag text-big">Enjoy tax benefits</h1>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The term tax benefit refers to any tax law that helps you reduce
                    your
                    tax liability. Benefits range from deductions and tax credits to exclusions and exemptions. They
                    cover
                    various areas, including programs for families, education, employees, and natural disasters.

                    Some tax benefits are related to the ability to pay tax. For example, the child tax credit and the
                    earned income tax credit recognize the cost of raising a family. Other tax benefits—including
                    mortgage
                    interest and charitable donation deductions—are incentives designed to further social policy goal
